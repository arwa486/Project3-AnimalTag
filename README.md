This is decentralized app (dApp) to digitially "tag" animals. Instead of using physical brandings or tags, the end-user (e.g. a farmer or rancher) can take a photo of their animals and 

## Objective 

The objective of this project is to create a decentralized application (dApp) that can be used to tag and track animals humanely. In contrast to physically tagging or branding animals, AnimalTag would allow end-users the abilitity to track their animals through photo and genetic record on the blockchain. Transfer of ownership is clear cut as

## Running the Project 

1. Most of the programming can be done in the Remix IDE as it allows for virtual compilation and can be used with various EVM sandboxes. ![](./Screenshots/deployedContract_addAnimalFunction.PNG)

2. Contract is based around three primary functions: `addAnimal()`, `transferFrom()` and `removeAnimal()`. ![](./Screenshots/deployedContract_callingTokenID.PNG)

## Future Development 

3. *@TODO*: interface Solidity code with Python/Web3 or Node.js.
