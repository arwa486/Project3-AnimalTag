# Project 3 - AnimalTag

## Team Members 
- Alex Rwamashongye 

## Project Description 

This decentralized app (dApp) to take in photos of farm animals and tag them to have the data store in a decentralized manner. Basically an exchange of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) of animals.  

## Objective 

Develop a smart contract to take in photos as a particular animal id. Allow users to buy, sell, and exchange animals

## Data Sources / Technologies 

- [Open Zeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/)
- [Chainlink](https://chain.link/)

## Breakdown of Tasks 
- Figure out the connection between uers, NFTS, and the blockchain protocol (e.g. if a farmer needs to buy FARM coin and stake on the network, is it useful?)
- Draft an outline of features and functions to be implemented. 
    - Import photos 
    - Buy, send or trade animal NFTs 
- Create the smart contract. 
- Test the contract on testnetwork or on localhost to debug and understand the contract logic. 
- Create a UI that can be accessed. 
    - If time allows, create a UI that is mobile-friendly. 
- Create demo for presentation and slide deck discussing project. 
- Extra: create graphics and "investor pitch."
